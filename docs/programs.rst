Programs
========

Programs are collections of courses codes offered together. Each "course code" in a Program consists of a collection of course runs, specific instances of a course which a student may take on their way to completing a Program. Together with rules governing which courses may be added to a Program, Programs can be used to support product lines like edX's XSeries offering.

Authoring App
-----------------
This application is for creating and managing groupings of courses, which we refer to as **programs**.


You may notice that there are 2 versions of the application (core & dev). The core version includes the ability to create new programs and view existing ones. The dev version extends this to also include a programs list view. So the contents of each app are:

+----------+---------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
|          | Create Program View | Program Details View | Program List View |
