Programs
========

Programs are collections of courses codes offered together. Each "course code" in a Program consists of a collection of course runs, specific instances of a course which a student may take on their way to completing a Program. Together with rules governing which courses may be added to a Program, Programs can be used to support product lines like edX's XSeries offering.
